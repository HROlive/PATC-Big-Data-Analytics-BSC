## Description

The objective of this course was to introduce the main concepts and technologies related to Big Data and Data Analytics and its applications to real projects.
The course brought together key information technologies used in manipulating, storing, and analysing data.

Students were introduced to systems that can accept, store, and analyse large volumes of unstructured data. The learned skills can be used in data intensive application areas.

## Information

The overall goals of this course were the following:
> - Introduction to storage and process unstructured data. Main concepts of NoSQL databases;
> - Large scale processing: Apache Spark and its core libraries for data manipulation, machine learning, data streams and graph analytics;
> - Characterization of a data mining problem and its relation with business intelligence, dig data and exploratory statistics;
> - Basics of Python deep learning technics with TensorFlow;
> - Basic concepts of data visualization and tools.
